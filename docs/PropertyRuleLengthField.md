## {{ page.title }}

The `{{ page.title }}` {{ site.data.linkVariables["PropertyRule"] }} is intended to be used to make a property named "Length" be automatically 
set up as an <makeLink>CalculatedLengthResult</makeLink> property.  This will be applied to any field name "Length" that does not
already have a <makeLink>CalculatedLength</makeLink> or <makeLink>CalculatedLengthResult</makeLink> property.
